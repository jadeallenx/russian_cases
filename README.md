This is a tool to make example sentences using the word lists that are included in this
project.  There's a comma delimited file with nouns, a comma delimited file with adjectives
and a comma delimited file with pronouns.

The tool reads these files when it starts and then can create some example sentences
which will:

* help you get used to the various word endings
* figure out when certain cases apply

Later I expect to incorporate this into a web application which will probably drive
some kind of quiz you can do from a browser.

Adding words
------------
If you're interested in adding a word or words, feel free to fork this project and

If you don't know how to do that, please make (or login) to your github user account
and open an issue with the information about the word to add. (If you need help
to do this, [watch this how-to video](https://vimeo.com/123803128).)
